It's been just over a year since my last blog post and I'm back, with a fresh theme made from scratch! There's not much
to report on regarding the new blog, I'm still running [Zola](https://getzola.org) but I'm now hosting on github pages.
The handmade theme has no external dependencies and is a ton of cobbled together css, but it works.

I'm going to try and write here at least once a week, but it really depends on inspiration. The only thing left for this
site is the addition of a Portfolio section or a job history section. I've yet to add the portfolio because I'm not sure
what would go in it :D
